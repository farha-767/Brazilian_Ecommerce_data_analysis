-- To analyze seasonal patterns more deeply, consider extending the query to include year-over-year comparisons or
  calculating month-over-month growth rates.        
-- You could also visualize the results using line charts to better illustrate trends and seasonal fluctuations.
-- Additionally, incorporating external factors such as holidays or promotional events could provide further context to the observed trends.
