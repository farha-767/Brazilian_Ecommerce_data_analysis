/*"What payment methods do customers prefer and how do they correlate with order value?"

Why this matters: Optimize payment processing and understand customer preferences.

What to analyze:

Payment method popularity

Average order value by payment type

Payment installments analysis

SQL concepts to practice:

Single table deep analysis

Multiple aggregate functions

CASE statements for categorization

Percentage calculations*/;
