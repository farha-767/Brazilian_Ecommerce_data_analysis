/*
"How efficient is our delivery process across different regions?"

Why this matters: Identify operational bottlenecks and regional performance variations.

What to analyze:

Average delivery time by state

On-time delivery performance

Freight cost analysis

SQL concepts to practice:

Date arithmetic (date1 - date2)

JOINs with geographic data

Conditional aggregates

NULL handling for incomplete deliveries
